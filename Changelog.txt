- Added configs for
	- Graze Noise
	- Graze Hitbox
	- TP bar being visible while a non-TP affecting item is held(?)

- Fixed an exploit where falling blocks generate TP
- Made combination Ribbons incompatible with their downgrades
- Fixed TP items being weird when it came to potion sickness


- Balancing:
	- White Ribbon: 25% reduced Potion Sickness from TP items -> TP items restore 25% more TP
