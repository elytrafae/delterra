Delterra is a mod aimed at making your Terraria experience more fun by adding features inspired by the popular hit indie game, Deltarune.

Currently, the mod adds:
[list]
[*]The TP mechanic! Attack, Defend and graze bullets and enemies to gain TP and unleash powerful effects!
[*]Tension Bit, Tension Gem and Tension Max, powerful items that can fill your TP bar at the cost of Potion Sickness
[*]Axes, which are all true melee weapons, with the shared ability to cast Rude Buster, a powerful damaging spell!
[*]Rings, magic weapons that cost both TP and mana to unleash a delayed, but powerful Ice Shock anywhere you desire.
[*]Heal Prayer, a healing spell you can get better versions of as you progress
[*]Ralsei the Dark Prince, a brand new town NPC, who moves in the moment you have available housing for him.
[*]Several new accessories to spice up gameplay
[*]A brand new post-Moon Lord armor set
[*]A meme
[*]A music box, with a familiar song remixed by jteoh
